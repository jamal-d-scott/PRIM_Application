# PRIM_Application v2.0
Password Recollection Integrated Management (PRIM)

I often found at times that I did not remember my own passwords to many different sources. It was fairly difficult to remain consistent with my password security such that no two passwords were the same, and that all passwords were strong enough and memorable. I am not a fan of 3rd party software which stores your information and mnages that for you. To solve my problem, I created PRIM, a modern UI C# WinForm application built on the Metro Framework which will encrypt\decrypt my information so it is not in plain text on my drive, and recall my passwords for several different "categories." PRIM can update and remove passwords at the user's command and has full error handling support.
